# Welcome to bwuhos :3

bwuhos is a hobbyist operating system with its own unique kernel (both in terms
of design and implementation). This OS will have filesystem support, some
utilities, and its own shell.

The source code is available on [the GitHub](https://github.com/tirimid/bwuhos)
under a free software license, the GNU GPLv3. Feel free to study it and use its
code when developing your own free software operating systems.

Thank you for checking out bwuhos.
